						<h3>What is Sugar Snake?</h3>
						<p>Sugar Snake is a fun multiplication practice game.</p>
						<p>You play a snake eating yummy "multapples" with the goal to be the largest snake ever!</p>
						<p>But watch out! Eating the wrong answers will send you off course!</p>

						<h3>Using Sugargame - Starting Troubles</h3>
						<p>Sugargame, a variant of pygame made specifically for use with the XO machines came with a few difficulties starting up and along the way like:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Keyboard controls</li>
							<li>Menu buttons</li>
							<li>Events handling with Sugar GTK</li>
						</ul>

					<h3>Difficulties - What we would have done differently</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Getting setup was a little difficult especially getting our code to integrate into a Sugar Activity</li>
                        <li>We had a few issues sticking to our process of branching and then merging, but were able to re-group onthat</li>
                    </ul>

				    <h3>What went well</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Pretty good mix of skills in the team</li>
                        <li>Was able to successfully understand and be able to alter the pre-existing Planked code to our needs</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h3>Given more time...</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Difficulty levels to allow for varying degrees of math problems</li>
						<li>Testing different implementations of the game, i.e. eating wrong problem would reduce size, not be a game over</li>
						<li>Create a nice icon for the Sugar OS to recognize as an activity</li>
