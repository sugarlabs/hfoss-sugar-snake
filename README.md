# hfoss-sugar-snake
This is our final project for [RIT's HFOSS class](https://github.com/ritjoe/hfoss) in spring 2018. Our game sugar-snake is meant to be run on the Sugar operating system as an educational activity reviewing the multiplication tables for 4th grade students. It is based off of a simple snake game called [Plaked](https://github.com/amarlearning/Plaked).
