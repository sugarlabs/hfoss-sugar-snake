# Team Proposal

## List your other team members below

  * Regina Locicero rtl3971@rit.edu
  * Aidan Kahrs axk4545@rit.edu
  * Quintin Reed qar4778@rit.edu
  * Calvin Wu cxw7054@rit.edu

## Which Math Standard did you pick?

4.N.16  Understand various meanings of multiplication and division
4.N.17  Use multiplication and division as inverse operations to solve problems

These are from the [New York Standards for 4th Graders](http://www.p12.nysed.gov/ciai/mst/math/standards/revisedg4.html).

## 2-liner description of the project?

Our game will be similar to the traditional snake game where you eat the blocks to get longer and can't run into yourself. For the eating mechanic, a multiplication problem will be placed on screen and multiple solutions will pop up with there being one or a few right answers based on difficulty, and eating the right one will award points and length, while the opposite will take away points and length.


## What will each team member's role be?

Quintin Reed: Design

Aidan Kahrs: Development

Regina Locicero: Documentation and Development

Calvin Wu: Design and Development

All of us will be a part of development. We will split up the work as evenly as possible and according to skills.


# Source Code Repository URL?

[Our repo with our documentation](https://github.com/axk4545/hfoss-sugar-snake)

## What are the easy parts?

  * Documentation

## What are the hard parts?

  * Development

## How will you overcome both?

For development issues we will make sure to break down the game into manageable peices and fairly distribute the pieces to the rest of the group. We will make sure to focus on getting our minimum viable product working first to ensure we don't get over our heads.
